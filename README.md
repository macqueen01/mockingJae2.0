# Brand New Mocking Jae

Mocking Jae service is a personal blog-like social service that will allow users to interact only through images.
These images will become a root or part of MEME. 

## Running the frontend

Everything you need to do to run Mocking Jae frontend server is to type 

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
 
Frontend server will run in your local port [5173].
Simple as that. Done!
